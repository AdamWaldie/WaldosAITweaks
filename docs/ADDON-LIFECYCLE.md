# Addon lifecycle and feature integration

WAIT is an addon, not a mission script bootstrap. Loading the mod registers its functions,
settings and runtime entry points. Missions do not copy its files or execute an initialization script.

## Startup and authority

CBA pre-init loads guarded defaults and registers the shared tuning specification on every machine.
CBA owns global setting persistence and synchronization. Post-init starts enabled systems after addon
initialization. The server coordinates cross-group decisions; the current AI owner executes movement,
fire and local handlers. Interface clients provide Zeus controls and interruption monitoring.

Retained function and setting names are compatibility identifiers. Changing display text must not
rename them or invalidate mission overrides. Native engine danger remains active; WAIT adds finite operations rather than a second permanent
movement controller. An original danger replacement must pass acceptance before it is enabled.

## Existing improvements remain in scope

| Subsystem | Existing implementation retained | Runtime mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skills and visibility | Profiles, ambient light, equipment heuristics, operator/cargo distinction and dispersion | Local creation/locality events plus bounded refresh |
| Infantry | Contact, cover, fire control, advance, flank, assault, withdrawal, morale, surrender and recovery | Shared budgeted scheduler, finite drill FSM and sparse danger events |
| Buildings | Garrison, clearance, casualty replacement and task handover | Owner-local building tasks with ownership checks; traversal remains subject to live acceptance |
| Coordination | Contact communication, support by fire, multi-squad and combined-arms responder roles | Server decisions and expiring owner-local operations |
| Vehicles | Convoy, passengers, gunnery, obstruction and non-teleport recovery | Native commands with bounded progress jobs and seat ownership |
| Aircraft | Weapon-aware attack choices, defence, countermeasures, landing and braking | Finite owner-local jobs, missile events and terrain checks |
| Support and reactions | Artillery warning/support, airborne/naval operations and civilian reactions | Event-driven requests and finite scheduled responses |
| Operator controls | Per-feature gates, diagnostics, Zeus replacement and script API | Shared setting specification and explicit ownership |

Retention is not acceptance: building traversal, aircraft geometry, coordinated movement and measured
performance still need fresh batched game tests. The feature coverage manifest records outstanding cases.

## Runtime changes

CBA callbacks defer work until addon post-init. Skill/profile changes reconfigure the existing local
skill worker. Master disable releases WAIT-owned operations; it does not erase externally owned state.
Grenade-evasion and civilian-reaction switches immediately reconcile their optional handlers through
the repeat-safe installer. Turning them back on must work without restarting the mission. Other
behaviour gates are read by their finite jobs and eligibility checks; this does not justify installing
another worker for each setting.

A newer Zeus or mission order invalidates the current operation. Cleanup restores only state still
owned by that operation. Locality migration retires stale work and lets the new owner adopt eligible AI.
No tactical job waits indefinitely for a grenade animation, a casualty, or every straggler to arrive.

## Choosing addon mechanisms

The shared tuning specification carries each option's activation policy into CBA help and the
generated settings reference. Live controls follow their callback or next owner-local update.
Next-operation controls are guaranteed when new intent starts; active work keeps committed geometry
and may adopt safety values earlier. No runtime control currently requires a restart. Optional engine
policies will require package selection and restart rather than a reversible checkbox.

The script tuning API validates input and changes CBA's server layer. It does not send a second
settings snapshot or install duplicate workers. CBA handles effective-value synchronization and JIP;
the published revision counter is diagnostic only. Settings changes are not a multi-key atomic
transaction. Physical server-enforcement and JIP acceptance remain pending.

Use config for declarations and dependencies, CBA settings for reversible configuration, events for
sparse stimuli, finite FSMs for transitions, and the existing scheduler for bounded due work. A config
change that cannot be undone at runtime must never be presented as a reversible setting. Do not put
terrain queries, global scans or movement reissue loops in unconditional FSM transitions.

Core, infantry, vehicles, aircraft, support and compatibility are separate mandatory PBOs. The
bootstrap registers the function catalogue and starts enabled owner-local systems after its component
dependencies load. Components do not add schedulers. Engine-policy PBOs remain a separate pending
implementation and must not be advertised as available until packaged and validated.

## Validation

The sequential build checks source, config, settings parity, documentation, performance contracts,
FSM validity and packaging. Game validation uses the packaged addon and dedicated-server/client audit.
Next batched acceptance includes disable/re-enable of optional handlers, JIP and headless migration,
Zeus replacement during manoeuvres, active external ownership, and the feature behaviour matrix.
Measured performance compares the same 50 mixed groups against baseline AI: at most 5 percent added
median frame time and 10 percent added p95 frame time. Static checks cannot establish that budget.

Owner-local startup waits for CBA's settings-initialized event after post-init refresh.
Guarded pre-init defaults do not establish effective settings readiness. Direct server start/stop
requests use the CBA server layer; callbacks perform local setup and cleanup.

## Shared queue ownership

Tactics and skill adjustment share one owner-local callback and the configured soft budget.
Skill refresh examines at most ten registered units per second, writes only changed layers and
continues when tactics are disabled or paused. Tactical job delays retain low-FPS backoff;
the bounded skill refresh does not inherit that backoff. Stopping either runtime retires its jobs
without disabling the other. Stopping the last runtime removes the callback. Skill stop advances
its generation so stale jobs cannot revive after a quick restart. No job is replayed across owners;
locality adoption registers the new owner's units.

The scheduler audit checks actual skill refresh with tactics disabled and physical queued movement
with skills disabled, then callback removal when both stop. The c0e9009 packaged scheduler batch
completed server and client acceptance with 267 passing checks and no reported SQF errors.
This validates that focused batch, not combat tactics or frame-time overhead. The shared budget
is soft and cannot pre-empt an executing SQF function; 50 mixed-group
median/p95 frame-time acceptance remains required.
